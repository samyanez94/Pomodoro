# Pomodoro

JavaFX is the most common way to make Graphical User Interfaces (or GUIs) in Java. It is robust and customizable, 
and getting familiar with its APIs exposes many application design best practices. Following a course by Craig Denis
from [Treehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com) on JavaFX, I decided to build a pomodoro timer. 

A pomodoro timer is a tool used for the [Pomodoro Technique by Francesco Cirillo](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique).
It is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short
breaks. These intervals are named pomodoros, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
